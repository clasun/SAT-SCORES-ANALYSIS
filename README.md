# Relationship Between School Demographics and Educational Outcomes: Evidence from NYC Public Schools

## Abstract
This research project explores the impact of specific school demographics on academic performance in New York City public schools, focusing on variables such as racial background, location, income level, and population size. Our findings suggest significant associations between certain demographic factors and SAT scores, emphasizing the need for updated policies to address disparities in the education system.

## Introduction
In recent years, standardized testing, particularly SAT scores, has faced increased scrutiny, raising questions about inequality in access to opportunities and resources. This study builds on previous research, including [Este and Eini√∂'s paper](link_to_paper) and [Abdulkadiroglu, Hu, and Pathak's paper](link_to_paper), to investigate the relationship between school demographics and academic outcomes in NYC public schools.

## Objectives
Our paper aims to unify diverse studies on predictors of SAT scores, offering a comprehensive analysis of New York City's public schools. Leveraging data analysis techniques such as summary statistics, visual graphs, mapping, and regression, we seek to identify factors influencing SAT scores and propose potential interventions for the education system.

## Data

  - Median income per zip code ($USD)
  - Population per zip code
  - Neighborhood safety

### Sample Size and Cleaning
- Original dataset: 435 schools
- Final dataset: 374 observations after cleaning
- Data cleaning involved dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing values, merging datasets, and converting strings to numeric values.
